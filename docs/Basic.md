Overview
========

A web site which displays a tango* to the user for one day, after seven days the user will be presented with a test to see if they can remember the tango. 
If they get it correct then it will be marked as complete.

There will be an Android application as well as a web interface. Both the android app and the web interface will use OpenID to authenticate the user.  

Web Interface
=============

The web interface will use Bootstrap, and a DBMS to store the tangos and user information. (In theory this can be accessed by the Android app).

\* A tango is a fact, word or piece of memorable information.

Database
========
