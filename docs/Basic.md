Overview
========

A web site which displays a tango* to the user for one day, after seven days the user will be presented with a test to see if they can remember the tango. 
If they get it correct then it will be marked as complete.

There will be an Android application as well as a web interface. Both the android app and the web interface will use OpenID to auth the user.
